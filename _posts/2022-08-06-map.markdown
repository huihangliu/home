### 1. Model averaging prediction

This is a brilliant idea for improving the prediction performance of a model by avearging some other parameters from other models/populations. 

Suppose that the main model, that is the model we want to predict, is a linear model, $y=x\beta+\epsilon$. 
And $$y=x\beta+\epsilon$$.
