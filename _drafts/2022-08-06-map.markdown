## 1. Model averaging prediction

This is a brilliant idea for improving the prediction performance of a model by avearging some other parameters from other models/populations. 

Suppose that the main model, that is the model we want to predict, is a linear model, $y=x\beta+\epsilon$. 
And $$y=x\beta+\epsilon$$. 
$$
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    a^2 + b^2
  \end{aligned}
  \label{A.1}
\end{align}
$$

$\eqref{A.1}$
